###Tickle for iOS

This interactive animation demo has the little fellow take a bath where he needs some assistance in setting the water temperature and getting soap and towel.

This app has started as a proof-of-concept for Nintendo DS written in C++ using a self-contained library for framebuffer graphics animation. The library and the entire application where ported to Objective C to 
see if that could be done in a sensible amount of time.


There are no plans to take this app any further, and from an iOS development standpoint it is rather rough.

Anyway if there are any questions I will be happy to answer.

###Remarks

The project compiled successfully on Xcode 7.2 and El Crapitain, but I cant tell whether that would work as smoothly on somebody elses system.
